# Comments And Code Formatting

### Bad - Comments
* Redundant information
* Dividers/Block Markers
* Misleading Comments
* Commented-Out Code

### Good - Comments
* Legal Information
* Explanations which can't be replaced by good naming
* Warnings
* Todo Notes
* Documentation Strings (Esp for public libraries)
  
###### Note : Generally Avoid Comments with only very few exceptions

### Code Formatting

* Code Fromatting Improves Readability & Transports Meaning

  1. Vertical Formatting : Space Between lines, Grouping Code
      * Code should be readable like an essay - top to bottom without too many "jumps"  
      * Consider splitting files with multiple concepts (e.g. classes) into mutliple files
      * Diffent concepts ("areas") should be separated by spcing
      * Similar concepts ("areas") should not be separated by spacing
      * Related concepts should be kept close to each other.


  2. Horizontal Formatting : Indentation, Space between code (in single line), Line width
      *  Lines of code should be readable without scrolling. Avoid very long "sentences"
      *  Use Indentation - even if not required technically (for Python it need's technically)
      *  Break long statments into multiple shorter ones
      *  Use clear but not unreadably long names

* Formatting rules differ between languages
* Follow language-specific conventions and guidelines (Search for "[LANGUAGE] style guide")
